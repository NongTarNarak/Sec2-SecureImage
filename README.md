Secure Image System
Welcome to the Secure Image System, powered by AES encryption and SHA-256 hashing.

>Folder
    CipherText:
        > To export the encrypted images from the system in JSON format.
        > You can decrypt the image by option: 5 from this folder.

    Decrypted_image:
        > All decrypted images will be stored in this designated folder.
    
    PlainText_image:
        > Begin by placing all the images you wish to encrypt into this designated folder.

How to Use:
>>Option 1: Save the image with AES
    1) Upload the image you want to encrypt to the folder named "PlainText_image"
    2) Choose option "1" and provide the path to your image
    3) Name your image
    4) Specify the image type (you can choose any type you prefer)
    5) Set your password for encrypting the image (please remember this password as it will be needed for decrypting)

>>Option 2: Decrypt an Image
    1) Enter the name of the image you want to decrypt >>press 3 for encrypted image's table<<
    2) Provide the password used for encryption
    3) The decrypted image will be saved to the folder named "Decrypted_image"
    

>Option 3: List All Cipher Images
    View a list of all cipher images on your system, including their names


>Option x: Exit
>Option r: Reboot
