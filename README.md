Secure Image System
Welcome to the Secure Image System, powered by AES encryption and SHA-256 hashing.

How to Use:
>>Option 1: Encrypt an Image
    1) Upload the image you want to encrypt to the folder named "PlainText_image"
    2) Choose option "1" and provide the path to your image
    3) Name your image
    4) Specify the image type (you can choose any type you prefer)
    5) Set your password for encrypting the image (please remember this password as it will be needed for decrypting)

>>Option 2: Decrypt an Image
    2.1): Decrypt from Local Storage
        2.1.1) Enter the name of the image you want to decrypt
        2.1.2) Provide the password used for encryption
        2.1.3) The decrypted image will be saved to the folder named "Decrypted_image"
    2.2): Decrypt from Uploaded JSON
        2.2.1) Enter the image name
        2.2.2) Use the default password "ICT555"
        2.2.3) Proceed as above

>Option 3: List All Cipher Images
    View a list of all cipher images on your system, including their names, password lengths, and whether they were uploaded or encrypted.

>Option 4: Export Cipher Images to JSON
    Export cipher images to a JSON file for safekeeping. You can decrypt these images in the future by uploading them into the system (Option 5).

>>Option 5: Insert Cipher Images (JSON) into the System
    5.1): Upload JSON File
        5.1.1) Place the .json file in the "CipherText" folder
        5.1.2) Provide the path to your JSON file
    5.2): Decrypt and Import JSON File
        5.2.1) Place the .json file in the appropriate folder
        5.2.2) Provide the path to your JSON file
        5.2.3) The decrypted image will be saved to the "Decrypted_image" folder on your system
